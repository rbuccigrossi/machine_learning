THE INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION&VALIDATION (IV&V) PROGRAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION ON NASA MISSION-CRITICAL SOFTWARE. THE IV&V OFFICE
(IVVO), WITHIN THE IV&V PROGRAM, CONSISTS OF FOUR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS: IV&V PROJECTS (IVVP), TECHNICAL QUALITY&EXCELLENCE (TQ&E), RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) AND THE SOFTWARE
ASSURANCE TOOLS (SWAT) GROUP. THE NASA IV&V SWAT GROUP SUPPORTS THE IV&V PROGRAM BY SERVING AS THE CENTRAL HUB FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF COMPUTER AIDED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (CASE) TOOLS, AND OTHER TOOL-BASED ENGINEERING SERVICES. THE SWAT GROUP HAS BEEN CREATED TO PROMOTE THE SHARED USE OF ALL DEVELOPED AND COMMERCIAL CASE TOOLS HAVING APPLICABILITY TO IV&V ACTIVITIES. THE SWAT GROUP REQUIRES CONTRACTOR SUPPORT TO EVOLVE, EVALUATE, INTEGRATE, IMPROVE, AND MAINTAIN CASE TOOL SOLUTIONS BASED UPON THE NEEDS OF IV&V PROGRAM ACTIVITIES.
CONTRACTOR SUPPORT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN RESIDENT EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND PROVIDE TRAINING ON ALL DEVELOPED OR PURCHASED CASE TOOLS UTILIZED BY THE IV&V PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS TO SUPPORT THE NASA IV&V SWAT GROUP BY PROVIDING MANAGEMENT, CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, TRAINING, AND ENGINEERING SERVICES OF THE IV&V COMPUTER AIDED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (CASE) TOOLS THAT ARE UTILIZED BY THE IV&V PROGRAM.
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2.0 OF THIS DOCUMENT.
TO SUMMARIZE, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL SUPPORT THE SWAT GROUP IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:
- INTEGRATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) SOLUTIONS INTO THE IVVO OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT
- PROVIDING CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF THE SERVICES OFFERED AND THE CASE TOOLS PROVIDED AS AN OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY
- SERVING AS THE PRIMARY INTERFACE FOR CASE TOOL AND HARDWARE REQUESTS FROM IVVO GROUPS
