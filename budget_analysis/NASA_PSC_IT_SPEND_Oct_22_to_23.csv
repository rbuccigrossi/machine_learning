KEY OBJECTIVES OF THE SCNS CONTRACT ARE TO DECREASE COST AND MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND RELIABILITY, WHILE MAINTAINING AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK AND PROVIDING FOR SAFE OPERATION OF THE MISSIONS.   THE CONTRACTOR SHALL IMPLEMENT A SAFETY, HEALTH, AND MISSION ASSURANCE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT, MINIMIZES PROGRAM RISK, AND MAXIMIZES NASA MISSION SUCCESS.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR ACHIEVING THE REQUIRED RESULTS.
CORE REQUIREMENT FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT, QUALITY ASSURANCE, ETC. ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT IDIQ TASK ORDERS.  
THE SPACE NETWORK (SN) IS COMPRISED OF A FLEET OF ON-ORBIT TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITES (TDRS) AND ASSOCIATED GROUND SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.  THE NATURE OF THE SN ARCHITECTURE, I.E., EXTREMELY LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, CONTRACTOR OPERATED FACILITIES, CONTINUOUS 24X7 REQUIREMENTS, ETC., LENDS ITSELF TO A CORE REQUIREMENTS APPROACH.  
THE GROUND NETWORK (GN) CONSISTS OF AN ORBITAL TRACKING NETWORK AND THE SATELLITE LASER RANGING NETWORK.  THE NATURE OF THE GROUND NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, I.E., DIVERSE MIX OF COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT ASSETS, EVOLVING GEOGRAPHIC AND TECHNICAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND LEGACY SYSTEMS, ETC. LENDS ITSELF TO AN IDIQ APPROACH.
