edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged “whale” and a 
“narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks 
much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is 
enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be 
palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys.
