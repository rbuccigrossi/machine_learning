news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never 
delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; 
bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of 
what you shall have for dinnerâ€”for all your meals for three years and more 
are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
