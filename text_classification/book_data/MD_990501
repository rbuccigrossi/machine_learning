babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are you hurrying about? 
Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing 
more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your knives in two—that’s all. 
Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers 
and lungs!”
