started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto, 
I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in December. Much was I 
disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already 
sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following 
Monday.
