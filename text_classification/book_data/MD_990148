2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear, 
bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the 
watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So, so, (thrusts 
his head down the scuttle,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y! Eight bells there 
below! Tumble up!
