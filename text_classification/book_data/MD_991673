Is it not a saying in every oneâ€™s mouth, Possession is half of the law: that 
is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is 
the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and 
Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law?
