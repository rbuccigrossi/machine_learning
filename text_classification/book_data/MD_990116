cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three most honorable gentlemen 
and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when the great 
Pope washes the feet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet 
cardinals! your own condescension, that shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; 
ye will it. Cut your seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”
