First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of 
the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with 
congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some oil. After being 
severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere 
going to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.
