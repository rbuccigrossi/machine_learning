God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, 
man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no; stay on board, on 
board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives chase to Moby Dick. That 
hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the far away home I see in that 
eye!”
