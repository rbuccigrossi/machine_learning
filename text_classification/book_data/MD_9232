his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it 
reminded me of General Washingtonâ€™s head, as seen in the popular busts of 
him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the 
brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly 
wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
