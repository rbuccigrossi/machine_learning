“Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing ten 
inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art still an 
impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a 
leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit, 
Captain Peleg.”
