“There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens! look down 
here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye creative 
libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s home henceforth, while 
Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords 
woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s down.”
