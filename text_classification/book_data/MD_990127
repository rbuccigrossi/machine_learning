wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and what I’ve willed, I’ll do! 
They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m demoniac, I am madness maddened! 
That wild madness that’s only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was 
that I should be dismembered; and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I 
will dismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one.
