thing; the moreâ€™s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person, 
afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him 
cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. And the man that 
has anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man 
than you perhaps think for.
