Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are good fellows enough. 
So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that’s 
the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my 
heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don’t be in a 
hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap your oars, you rascals?
