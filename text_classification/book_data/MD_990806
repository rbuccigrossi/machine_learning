Whaling Scenes.
In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here 
to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found 
in certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas, 
Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass that matter by.
