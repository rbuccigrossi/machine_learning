dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in darkness to his pallet, 
this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light, so he 
lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in 
it; so that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull still houses an 
illumination.
