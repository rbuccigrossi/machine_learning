knowledge,—as wild, untutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis 
now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but ’tis not me! that 
horror’s out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I 
try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye 
blessed influences!
