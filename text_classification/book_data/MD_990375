upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we 
spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, 
some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat’s crew. For 
God’s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, 
but at least one drop of man’s blood was spilled for it.
