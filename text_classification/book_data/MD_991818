strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathanâ€™s tail: it 
averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron 
part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern 
squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all 
impurities.
