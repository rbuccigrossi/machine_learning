very leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one 
else off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and 
throwing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the 
watery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.
