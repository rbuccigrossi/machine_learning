the banded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred 
vessels; manned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of 
dollars; the ships worth, at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year 
importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all 
this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?
