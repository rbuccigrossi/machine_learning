discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere, 
abounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures 
on the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam 
as of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon 
was cradled.
