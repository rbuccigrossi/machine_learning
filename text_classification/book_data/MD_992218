only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me? Seek out one 
Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think he’s in those far Antilles. If ye 
find him, then comfort him; for he must be very sad; for look! he’s left his 
tambourine behind;—I found it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and 
I’ll beat ye your dying march.”
