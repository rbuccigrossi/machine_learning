garden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat, 
and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always 
kept as sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like 
a razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is 
inserted for a handle.
