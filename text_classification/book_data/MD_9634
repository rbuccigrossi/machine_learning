conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who 
has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of 
the sperm whale’s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head. For 
what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked 
terrors and wonders of God!
