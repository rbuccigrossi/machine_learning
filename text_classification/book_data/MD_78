I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do 
so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the 
landlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not 
decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on 
so bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man’s blanket.
