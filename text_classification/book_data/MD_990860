a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own 
guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage 
tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes 
even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side 
with the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
