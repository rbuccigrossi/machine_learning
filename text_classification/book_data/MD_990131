My soul is more than matched; sheâ€™s overmanned; and by a madman! Insufferable 
sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But he drilled deep 
down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see his impious end; but 
feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I, the ineffable thing has tied 
me to him; tows me with a cable I have no knife to cut. Horrible old man!
