as in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that 
inexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to 
credit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying 
the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all 
ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.
