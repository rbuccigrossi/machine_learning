it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, 
augment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship 
that hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the 
fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of 
death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.
