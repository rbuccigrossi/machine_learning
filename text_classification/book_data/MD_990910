against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in what seemed an 
enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that dreamy mood losing all 
consciousness, at last my soul went out of my body; though my body still 
continued to sway as a pendulum will, long after the power which first moved it 
is withdrawn.
