no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long 
time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good 
offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, 
and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
