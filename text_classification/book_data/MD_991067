I admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as 
the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were 
simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is 
thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.
