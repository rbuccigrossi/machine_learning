whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness 
it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than 
terrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged 
tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or 
shark.*
