friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque, 
years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to 
spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired 
palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our 
sailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.
