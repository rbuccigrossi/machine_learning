“Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, 
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day 
coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? 
Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.”
