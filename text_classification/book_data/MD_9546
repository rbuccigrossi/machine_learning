I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging 
us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side 
of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us. 
This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced 
him in my heart, a humbug.
