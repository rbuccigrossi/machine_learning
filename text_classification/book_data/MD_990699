‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the 
cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as 
soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s not our interest; 
we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won’t be flogged.’
