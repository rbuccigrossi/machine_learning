the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all 
loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted with the high 
perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most 
malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night—good night! (waving 
his hand, he moves from the window.)
