sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory 
teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm 
Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no 
huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has 
two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
