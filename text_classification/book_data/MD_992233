Pottersâ€™ Fields of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and 
ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, 
drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie 
dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the 
ever-rolling waves but made so by their restlessness.
