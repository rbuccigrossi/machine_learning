(Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many 
naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible 
set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and 
especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have 
presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.
