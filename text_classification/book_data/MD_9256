never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of 
the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but 
the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then 
there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
