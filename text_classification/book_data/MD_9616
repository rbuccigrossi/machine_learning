there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful, 
careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to 
ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye all—and 
this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. 
Hurrah and away!”
