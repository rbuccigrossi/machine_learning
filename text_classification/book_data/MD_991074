marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsâ€”I should say, 
that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. 
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by 
hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, 
full-grown bulls of the species.
