shirr!—but spoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all 
over like my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt 
him! Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy 
on this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no 
bowels to feel fear!
