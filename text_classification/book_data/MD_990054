Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry 
guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I—being 
left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude—how could I 
but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale-ships’ standing orders, 
“Keep your weather eye open, and sing out every time.”
