indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and 
delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself 
still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of 
unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me 
in eternal mildness of joy.
