In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, 
saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one look at Ahab then, 
seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it 
symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of 
Leviathans was Ahab.
