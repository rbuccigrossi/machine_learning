As for the sign-paintersâ€™ whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops 
of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III. 
whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four 
sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities 
floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.
