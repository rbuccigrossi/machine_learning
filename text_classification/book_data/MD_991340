Whale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable 
of protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure 
back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone 
them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure, 
exalted to Joveâ€™s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.
