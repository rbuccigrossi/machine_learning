author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s, that 
ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this was 
written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale 
was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; 
it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne.
