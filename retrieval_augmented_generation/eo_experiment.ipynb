These goals may necessitate the collection and sharing of detailed information regarding the software and systems in use, which could include some aspects of an SBOM.\n"

      "Executive Order 14028 is titled \"Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity,\" and it states that the Federal Government must improve cybersecurity efforts to identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to malicious cyber actors. The order emphasizes that protecting the nation from malicious cyber actors requires the Federal Government to partner with the private sector and make significant investments to defend vital institutions. Incremental improvements will not give us the security we need. The order also directs federal agencies to deploy an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) initiative for proactive detection of cybersecurity incidents utilizing host-level visibility, attribution, and responses. Furthermore, it tasks Federal Information Systems with meeting or exceeding the standards and requirements for cybersecurity issued pursuant to this order.\n"
