Broadband,"Broadband programs are programs that support broadband infrastructure deployment and broadband adoption/digital inclusion activities. This includes programs that support state/local broadband planning and deployment efforts, broadband availability mapping, training and/or technical assistance. The term broadband commonly refers to high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access. Broadband includes several high-speed transmission technologies, such as fiber, wireless, satellite, digital subscriber line, and cable. Broadband adoption refers to the use of broadband in places where it is available, measured as the percentage of households that use broadband in such areas. Digital inclusion implies that individuals and communities have access to robust broadband connections; Internet-enabled devices that meet their needs; and the skills to explore, create and collaborate in the digital world."
Economic Development,"Economic Development programs are programs that, in whole or part, provide discretionary Federal grants or cooperative agreements – excluding loans – whose primary purpose is to catalyze economic growth, in particular targeting economically distressed communities, through investment in public and private facilities and infrastructure (i.e., bricks and mortar). Examples of such investments include, but are not limited to: commercial/industrial acquisition, construction, rehabilitation; water and sewer improvements; and community facilities."
Opioid Epidemic Response,"Opioid Epidemic Response programs are programs that predominately address health-related prevention, treatment, recovery and overdose death prevention for opioid use."
STEM Education,"STEM Education programs are programs that provide formal or informal (in school or out) education that is primarily focused on Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines, topics, or issues, as defined below. STEM disciplines include physical and natural sciences, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science disciplines, topics, or issues (including environmental science, environmental stewardship, and cybersecurity)."
Workforce Development,"Workforce Development programs are programs that seek to impart skills, furnish information, or provide employment opportunities to participants in furtherance of their careers; have a public-facing mission and benefit; and are not solely education programs (i.e., ones that take place strictly in educational settings and have only educational goals)."
Native American,"Native American programs are programs that in whole or in part benefit or relate to American Indians and Alaska Natives, including individuals, Tribal governments, village governments, urban Indian organizations, Alaska Native Corporations and Tribal communities.  Agencies were asked to report all funding for programs and activities that meet this definition.  This includes funding for programs and activities whose primary intent may not be to support or benefit Indian Country."
Flood Risk,"Flood Risk programs are programs that related to determining flood risk, including investments in the 3D Elevation Program (3DEP). 3DEP is a national program managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to acquire high-resolution elevation data. The goal of the cooperatively funded program is by 2023 to complete national lidar coverage for the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories; and IfSAR for Alaska.  3DEP provides a systematic approach for aligning federal, state and local investments in digital elevation models."
A.I. R&D/Quantum R&D,"A.I. R&D/Quantum R&D programs are programs that had research and development (R&D) funding in one of the following two areas:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) R&D advances the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence; this includes R&D in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing/understanding, intelligent decision support systems, autonomous systems, and the novel application of these techniques to various domains.

Quantum Information Science (QIS) R&D applies the best understanding of the sub-atomic world—quantum theory—to generate new knowledge and technologies."
Global Health,"Global Health programs are programs that directly support and/or have the explicit goal of supporting human health-related activities in countries outside of the United States. This includes, but is not limited to, programs identified as “health” under the State Department’s Foreign Assistance Standardized Program Structure and Definitions and research activities with a primary focus and goal of supporting health activities or outcomes outside of the United States.

This category does not include research intended primarily for domestic application and programs with a primary focus on non-human, animal health, though programs may have a secondary or indirect impact on animal health."
Homelessness,"Homelessness programs are programs that are fully targeted to people experiencing homelessness and/or are at-risk of homelessness. 

This category does not include mainstream or entitlement programs, e.g., Medicaid or state and local block grants, a portion of which often support homeless individuals but are not fully targeted to such populations."
HIV/AIDS,"HIV/AIDS programs are programs that provide funding for domestic HIV/AIDS care (health care services and treatment), cash/housing assistance, prevention, and research."
Transportation Infrastructure,"Transportation Infrastructure programs are programs that provide funding for transportation infrastructure, defined as physical assets used for transportation, that tend to be expensive, and that have moderate to long useful life-cycles. Examples of such assets include highways, bridges, tunnels, fixed rail guideway, transit stations, rolling stock, airports, runways, and ports. Funding was to be identified as amounts reportable on Schedule C lines 1313 and 1314 for construction and rehabilitation in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-11."
