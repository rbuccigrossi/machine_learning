Program Description: The Corps uses this funding to provide electronic navigational chart (ENC) data for all inland waterways and other federal navigation channels maintained by the Corps to be used by commercial electronic chart systems (ECS), which, when combined with the existing differential global positioning system (DGPS), will improve the safety and efficiency of marine navigation in both inland and coastal waterways of the United States.  On inland waterways, the Corps will collect more accurate survey and mapping data than is currently on its paper charts, and produce inland electronic navigation charts (IENCs) in accordance with navigation users and ECS vendors.  When combined in the commercial ECS, the technology will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of navigation.  This will allow safe navigation through bridge openings during fog and other bad weather conditions as well as during heavy traffic situations, and provide an accurate display for other systems such as radar and Automatic Identification Systems.  The Corps will use the S-57 international data format, the electronic data transfer standard prepared by the International Hydrographic Organization committee.  The S-57 format is consistent with electronic chart products produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the chart products produced by the two agencies will be coordinated for compatibility in adjoining areas.  The Corps will also coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard for aids to navigation information and collaboration on rules for chart carriage by waterway users.

Program Description: NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences created a breakthrough called WAWEnets, an objective measurement of speech quality and intelligibility, which leverages machine learning (ML) and big data to develop “no reference” speech quality estimation algorithms.  WAWEnets do not need the original speech signal and thus can measure telecommunications systems while they are in use. They remove the constraint of only being able to measure speech quality in a lab or when equipment is out of service, enabling formerly impossible testing – that is, when devices attempt to remove noise (or otherwise enhance speech signals) and no original speech-only signal exists, so testing of the transmitted result is the only viable option.

Program Description: Funding from this Activity is used to operate and maintain all NWS observing systems, evaluate observational requirements, engineer technical solutions, and perform systems development and testing. Together, these systems enable forecasters to identify emerging threats, characterize their severity, and provide detailed warnings and forecasts. Observing systems measure a broad array of parameters to support forecasting in the varied mission service areas of the NWS including aviation weather, severe weather, space weather, tropical weather, and more. All of these systems have strengths and weaknesses in monitoring the environment, so individual systems in the overall suite must complement each other. By gathering information from multiple sources, NWS ensures the most complete data picture possible.

No. 107-355) mandates that DOT and other designated federal agencies must “carry out a program of research, development, demonstration and standardization to ensure the integrity of pipeline facilities.” Specifically, PHMSA’s Pipeline Safety R&D Program’s mission is to sponsor R&D projects focused on providing near-term solutions that will improve the safety, reduce the environmental impact, and enhance the reliability of the Nation’s pipeline transportation system. The goals and objectives of the CAAP initiative, as discussed below, directly support both this mission and the congressional mandate.

The CAAP initiative is intended to spur innovation by enabling academic research focused on high technical risk and high payoff solutions for many pipeline safety challenges. It will potentially deliver solutions that can be handed off to PHMSA’s core research program for demonstration and deployment. The goal is to validate proof of concept for a thesis or theory along a logical path towards commercialization.

P3 offers students hands-on experience that brings their classroom learning to life, while also allowing them to create tangible changes in their communities. This annual, two-phased research grants program challenges students to research, develop, and design innovative projects that address real world challenges involving all areas of environmental protection and public health. Phase I serves as a “proof of concept,” where teams are awarded a one-year grant of up to $25,000 to develop their idea and showcase their research in the spring at EPA's National Student Design Expo (NSDE). These teams are then eligible to compete for a Phase II grant of up to $100,000 to implement their design in a real world setting. P3 aims to foster progress towards environmental awareness by achieving the symbiotic goals of improved quality of life for all people, economic prosperity, and protection of the planet - people, prosperity and the planet.
