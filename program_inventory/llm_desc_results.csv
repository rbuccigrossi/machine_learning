Program Description: The Corps uses this funding to provide electronic navigational chart (ENC) data for all inland waterways and other federal navigation channels maintained by the Corps to be used by commercial electronic chart systems (ECS), which, when combined with the existing differential global positioning system (DGPS), will improve the safety and efficiency of marine navigation in both inland and coastal waterways of the United States.  On inland waterways, the Corps will collect more accurate survey and mapping data than is currently on its paper charts, and produce inland electronic navigation charts (IENCs) in accordance with navigation users and ECS vendors.  When combined in the commercial ECS, the technology will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of navigation.  This will allow safe navigation through bridge openings during fog and other bad weather conditions as well as during heavy traffic situations, and provide an accurate display for other systems such as radar and Automatic Identification Systems.  The Corps will use the S-57 international data format, the electronic data transfer standard prepared by the International Hydrographic Organization committee.  The S-57 format is consistent with electronic chart products produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the chart products produced by the two agencies will be coordinated for compatibility in adjoining areas.  The Corps will also coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard for aids to navigation information and collaboration on rules for chart carriage by waterway users.  In coastal and Great Lakes areas, the Corps will produce standardized channel condition chart products that will provide consistent and reliable information to NOAA for chart updates, in accordance with Water Resources Development Act of 2000, Section 558.
