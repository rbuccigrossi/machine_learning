Mission/Purpose: Water resources
Program Description: The Corps uses this funding to provide electronic navigational chart (ENC) data for all inland waterways and other federal navigation channels maintained by the Corps to be used by commercial electronic chart systems (ECS), which, when combined with the existing differential global positioning system (DGPS), will improve the safety and efficiency of marine navigation in both inland and coastal waterways of the United States.  On inland waterways, the Corps will collect more accurate survey and mapping data than is currently on its paper charts, and produce inland electronic navigation charts (IENCs) in accordance with navigation users and ECS vendors.  When combined in the commercial ECS, the technology will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of navigation.  This will allow safe navigation through bridge openings during fog and other bad weather conditions as well as during heavy traffic situations, and provide an accurate display for other systems such as radar and Automatic Identification Systems.  The Corps will use the S-57 international data format, the electronic data transfer standard prepared by the International Hydrographic Organization committee.  The S-57 format is consistent with electronic chart products produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the chart products produced by the two agencies will be coordinated for compatibility in adjoining areas.  The Corps will also coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard for aids to navigation information and collaboration on rules for chart carriage by waterway users.  In coastal and Great Lakes areas, the Corps will produce standardized channel condition chart products that will provide consistent and reliable information to NOAA for chart updates, in accordance with Water Resources Development Act of 2000, Section 558.

Program Description: The Corps uses this funding to provide central oversight and support for its nationwide effort to enable local communities to understand the risks associated with levee systems that the Corps constructed for them.  The local communities are responsible for the operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of those levee systems.  The Corps also uses this funding to conduct risk assessments of certain high-risk federally authorized levee systems.  The Corps provides the results of these risk assessments to the local authorities that are responsible for these levee systems, in order to help them in managing their flood risk.

Agency: Corps of Engineers--Civil Works
Mission/Purpose: Water resources
Program Description: The Corps uses this funding to maintain and update data on dams in the United States, using a database called the National Inventory of Dams (NID).  The Corps initially compiled the NID in 1975, and has been updating it periodically since then with information provided by the state dam safety agencies, other Federal agencies that own or regulate dams, and the Corps (for its dams).  The updates reflect changes such as the construction of new dams, changes in ownership, major modifications to existing dams, decommissioning and removal of dams, and improvements in data accuracy and completeness.  The NID now includes 91,468 dams, most of which are privately owned.  With this funding, the Corps updates the data on these dams, improves information flow, and performs data quality control processes.  The Corps also uses this funding to upgrade the Geographic Information System interface used by the NID and to increase the integration of the NID with other dam and levee safety resources.

Program Description: NTIA's Institute for Telecommunication Sciences created a breakthrough called WAWEnets, an objective measurement of speech quality and intelligibility, which leverages machine learning (ML) and big data to develop “no reference” speech quality estimation algorithms.  WAWEnets do not need the original speech signal and thus can measure telecommunications systems while they are in use. They remove the constraint of only being able to measure speech quality in a lab or when equipment is out of service, enabling formerly impossible testing – that is, when devices attempt to remove noise (or otherwise enhance speech signals) and no original speech-only signal exists, so testing of the transmitted result is the only viable option.

Program Description: USAID continues to lead the global effort to prevent child and maternal deaths. Together with country and global partners, USAID is working to significantly reduce child and maternal deaths, with the goal of all countries having fewer than 20 deaths per 1,000 live births and fewer than 50 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2035. Reaching these rates would save an additional five million children each year and decrease the number of women who die from complications during pregnancy annually by 75 percent. USAID is a global leader in maternal and child health, and partners with governments to meet the health needs of their women and children. USAID's Acting on the Call reports present a roadmap with country-specific plans and updates on progress to address these needs. By helping keep women and children healthy, USAID is supporting countries on their pathway to self-reliance.
