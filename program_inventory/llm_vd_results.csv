They remove the constraint of only being able to measure speech quality in a lab or when equipment is out of service, enabling formerly impossible testing – that is, when devices attempt to remove noise (or otherwise enhance speech signals) and no original speech-only signal exists, so testing of the transmitted result is the only viable option.
